bcryptjs for password hashing

Classes should be created for each table in the database. Each class should contain its own form validation so the business layer only has to validate authorization

the entire front end...i added comments...good luck lol

organize front end into relevant folders

add bootstrap maybe.

Calender component needs to be updated for our needs, I figured it out just have to implement it.

Ervins create user form needs front end validation, other than that its good

Database tables need to be updated to have at least a password

Week and Day view for the calendar, these are big, this is where shifts should be editable. Gonna wanna meet and discuss how the hell were going to pull this off

Email forms need to be done, I asked anastasia, she never responded -_-
i think i even used @anastasia :/

someone with some sense of style should make this look good

set username field to max of 4 characters in the login form, mahmood told us about sql injection hacking, justttt to be sure.

create shift form, like the create user one
