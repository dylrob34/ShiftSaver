bcryptjs for password hashing
Business, application? and data layers of backend-----IN PROGRESS by dylan
the entire front end...
organize front end into relevant folders
MAYBE add models so a query from a route returns an object not just data, idk if we need this
add bootstrap maybe.


think we can avoid this, apparentely its a pain in the ass and there are simpler ways --MIGHT-- wanna use redux for login state.
 Any actions, meaning response from api saying ur not logged in, can change the state to logged off, which calls
a callback to render the app from the top showing login page.

figured out why front end couldnt grab name, key is not being saved and
sent with the request, the verifyKey middleware is stopping the req
and sending back {error: true} before it even reaches the route
